Crucian carp argued with ruff. Crucian carp said that it was possible to live in the world with one truth, and ruff argued that it was impossible to do without it, so as not to deceive. What exactly the ruff meant by the expression "to deceive" is unknown, but only every time he uttered these words, the crucian exclaimed in indignation:

— But this is meanness!

To which ruff objected:

- You'll see!

Crucian carp is a docile fish and prone to idealism: it is not for nothing that the monks love him. He lies more at the very bottom of a river pool (where it is quieter) or a pond, burrowing into the silt, and selects microscopic shells from there for his food. Well, naturally, he'll lie down, lie down, and invent something. Sometimes even very free. But since the crucians do not submit their thoughts to censorship, nor do they register in the police station, no one suspects them of political unreliability. If sometimes we see that from time to time a raid is organized on carp, it is not for free-thinking, but for the fact that they are delicious.

Carp are caught mainly with a net or seine; but in order for the fishing to be successful, it is necessary to have a knack. Experienced fishermen choose the time for this now after the rain, when the water is muddy, and then, starting a seine, they begin to slap the water with a rope, sticks and generally make noise. Having heard the noise and thinking that it heralds the triumph of free ideas, the crucian is removed from the bottom and begins to ask if he can somehow get attached to the celebration. It is here that he gets into a lot of trouble, in order to then become a victim of human gluttony. For, I repeat, crucians represent such a delicious dish (especially fried in sour cream) that the leaders of the nobility willingly regale even governors with them.

As for ruffs, this is a fish already touched by skepticism and, moreover, prickly. Being boiled in the ear, it gives an incomparable broth.

How it happened that the carp and the ruff got together, I do not know; I only know that once they got together, they immediately argued. They argued once, argued another time, and then they got into the taste, they began to assign dates to each other. They will merge somewhere under a water burdock and begin to talk intelligently. And the white-bellied roach frolics around them and is gaining intelligence.

The first one always bullied the crucian carp.

—I don't believe," he said, "that fighting and quarreling are a normal law, under the influence of which everything living on earth is supposedly destined to develop. I believe in bloodless prosperity, I believe in harmony and I am deeply convinced that happiness is not an idle fantasy of dreamy minds, but sooner or later it will become a common property!

- Wait!  ruff said ironically.

Ruff argued jerkily and restlessly. This is a nervous fish, which, apparently, remembers a lot of insults. It boiled in her heart... ah, it boiled! It has not yet come to hatred, but there is no faith and naivety in sight. Instead of a peaceful life, she sees strife everywhere; instead of progress, universal savagery. And he claims that anyone who has a claim to live should take all this into account. Crucian carp considers him "blissful", although at the same time he is aware that with him only one can "take the soul away".

— And I'll wait! - karas replied, - and I'm not the only one, everyone will wait. The darkness in which we swim is the product of a bitter historical accident; but since now, thanks to the latest research, it is possible to sort out this accident by the bones, then the reasons that gave rise to it can no longer be considered irremediable. Darkness is an accomplished fact, and light is the expected future. And there will be light, there will be!

- So, in your opinion, the time will come when there will be no pike?

— What kind of pikes? - the crucian carp was surprised, who was so naive that when they spoke in front of him: "That's why the pike is in the sea, so that the crucian does not doze," then he thought that it was something like those nicks and mermaids that scare small children, and, of course, he was not afraid of a crumb.

- Oh, you fofan, fofan! You want to solve world problems, but you have no idea about pike!

Ruff contemptuously wiggled his swimming feathers and sailed away; but, after a short time, the interlocutors again splashed somewhere in a secluded place (it's boring in the water) and again began to argue.

- In life, the good plays a leading role— - the crucian harangued, - evil is so, it is allowed by misunderstanding, but the main life force still closes in the good.

- Hold your pocket!

- Oh, ruff, what incongruous expressions you use! "Hold your pocket"! Is that the answer?

— Yes, you really shouldn't answer at all. You're stupid — that's the whole story for you!

- No, you listen to what I'm going to tell you. That evil has never been an underlying force — history testifies to this. Evil suffocated, crushed, devastated, put to the sword and fire, and only good was the underlying force. It rushed to the aid of the oppressed, it freed from chains and fetters, it awakened fruitful feelings in the hearts, it gave way to the soaring of the mind. If it were not for this truly fundamental factor of life, there would be no history. Because after all, in essence, what is history? The story is a tale of liberation, it is a story about the triumph of good and reason over evil and madness.

- And you, apparently, know for certain that evil and madness are put to shame?  ruff teased.

—They haven't been put to shame yet, but they will be put to shame—that's what I'm telling you right. And again, I will refer to history. Compare what once was with what is, and you will easily agree that not only the external methods of evil have softened, but its very amount has noticeably decreased. Take at least our fish breed. Previously, we were caught at all times, and mainly during the "move", when we, like stupefied, climb right into the net ourselves; but now it is during the "move" that it is recognized as harmful to catch us. Before, we could be said to have been exterminated in the most barbaric ways — in the Urals, they say, during the crimson, the water was red for many miles from fish blood, and now it is a sabbath. Seines, yes vershy, yes udy - more to no-no! And they also talk about this in the committees: what kind of seines? on what occasion? on what subject?

- And you, apparently, do not care how to get into the ear?

— What kind of ear? - the carp was surprised.

"Oh, damn you! It's called a crucian, but I haven't heard of an ear! What right do you have to talk to me after that? After all, in order to conduct disputes and defend opinions, it is necessary, at least, to get acquainted with the circumstances of the case in advance. What are you talking about, if you don't even know such a simple truth that every carp has an ear in front of him? Scat... I'll stab you!

The ruff bristled, and the crucian carp sank to the bottom as quickly as its clumsiness allowed. But after a day, the friends-opponents again intertwined and started a new conversation.

- The other day a pike looked into our pool— - the ruff announced.

—The one you mentioned the other day?"

- She is. Sailed, looked in, said: "It's like it's too quiet here! There must be a lot of water here?" And with that she sailed away.

— What should I do now?

- To be made - that's all. As soon as she sails in and stares at you with her eyes, you pick up the scales and feathers tighter, and straight up and climb into her throat!

— Why would I climb? If I were to blame for something…

"You're stupid—that's your fault. And fat in addition. And stupid and fat and the law commands the pike to climb into the hylo!

— There can be no such law! - karas was sincerely indignant. - And the pike has no right to swallow in vain, but must first demand an explanation. Here I will explain to her, I will lay out the whole truth. I'll break her sweat with the truth.

— I told you that you were a fofan, and now I will repeat the same thing: fofan! fofan! fofan!

The ruff was finally angry and promised himself to refrain from any communication with the crucian for the future. But after a few days, you look, the habit took its toll again.

- If only all the fish agreed with each other ... - the crucian began mysteriously.

But then Ruff himself was taken aback. "What is Fofan talking about? - he thought, - look, he's going to fail, and here a firebrand is walking around nearby. Look, and his eyes to the side, as if it wasn't his business, he squinted, but he himself listens."

— And you don't pronounce every word that comes into your mind! - he urged the carp, - there's nothing to open your mouth for: you can whisper what you need to say.

— I don't want to whisper— - continued the crucian calmly, - but I say straight out that if all the fish agreed with each other, then…

But here the ruff rudely interrupted his friend.

- With you, apparently, having eaten enough peas, it is necessary to talk! — he shouted at the carp and, having pricked up his skis, swam away from him.

And he was annoyed, and he was sorry for the carp. Although he is stupid, but still you can talk to him alone to your liking. He won't blab, he won't betray — in whom will you find these qualities now? It's a weak time now, such a time that you can't hope for your father and mother. Here is a roach, although it is impossible to say anything bad about it directly, but still, look, without understanding, he will blurt it out! And there is nothing to say about golovly, ide, tench and other servants! We are ready to take the oath under the bells for the worm! Poor carp! He wouldn't be lost between them for a penny!

- Look at you— - he said to Karas, - well, what kind of defense can you imagine yourself, no matter the hour? Your belly is big, your head is small, you don't have a lot of imagination, your mouth is chutoshny. Even the scales on you are not serious. No agility in you, no agility — as there is a bumpkin! Anyone who wants to, come to you and eat!

— But what am I for, if I have not been guilty? - karas persisted as before.

- Listen, you stupid breed! Do they eat something "for what"? Is it because they want to be executed? They eat because they want to eat - that's all. And you, tea, eat. You don't dig in the mud with your nose for nothing, but you catch shells. They, the shells, want to live, and you, the simpleton, stuff the mammoth with them from morning to evening. Tell me: what kind of guilt have they done to you that you execute them every minute? Do you remember how you said the other day: "If all the fish agreed with each other..." And what if the shells agreed with each other — would it be sweet for you, a simpleton, then?

The question was so bluntly and so unpleasantly posed that the crucian was embarrassed and blushed slightly.
